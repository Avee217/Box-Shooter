# Box-Shooter

Here the player is challenged with shooting moving boxes while taking note of their colour. Some add points, while other take away time.
The player must shoot the right coloured boxes to score enough points after which they can advance to the next level. 

The second level adds a new element of giving the player access to movement, forcing them to move and shoot behind obstacles
